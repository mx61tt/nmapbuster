# NmapBuster by @mx61tt

Initial ideia:
- Use in machines for OSCP exam
- Use in HackTheBox/Vulnhub machines

At the first scan is done a full port scan TCP nmap without scripts or version.
Then is used open/filtered/closed ports at the last result scan with scripts and versions scans.


### Using

```./nmapbuster.sh <IP>```

### Installation


```
git clone https://github.com/mtucunduva98/nmapbuster.git
cd nmapbuster/
chmod +x nmapbuster.sh
```
